# Getting Started with Guppy

> Guppy is a companion tool that aims to totally replace the terminal, so that newcomers to the field aren't burdened with a whole other skillset they need to learn before they can get started building cool things.
>
> It's currently in Alpha, which means that we're still a long way from fully realizing that dream. You may run into bugs, and it's only compatible with certain types of projects, and certain operating systems.
>
> Apologies in advance for any trouble you run into. Please leave feedback!

## Installation

Read the [Installation Guide](todo) to get the application downloaded and running.

## Your First Project

Guppy works on a per-project basis: each project has its own area in Guppy's interface. So, the first thing we need is a project to work on!

The intro screen presents two options: "Create a new web application" and "import an existing project".

### Creating a New Project

Choose this option if you want to start a brand new project.

The wizard will guide you through the process, but this guide will add some additional detail on the fields you'll need to fill out.

#### Project Name

Your project name can be whatever you want! Special characters are cool. So are emoji ðŸŽ‰ give it whatever name you want.

There is currently no way to change the project name from within Guppy, but you can always [modify the package.json](todo) to use a different name.

#### Project Type

There are currently 2 types of supported projects: Vanilla React, and Gatsby.

**Vanilla React** is a minimal yet fully-ready-to-go solution for getting started with React development. It uses [create-react-app]() behind the scenes, a tool built by Facebook, and has become the standard way that new applications are created, for beginners and experienced developers alike.

**Gatsby** is an amazing project that strives to be a static site generator, somewhat like Jekyll. It does a bunch of powerful performance optimizations, so the site you build is lightning-quick. It also has a vibrant community behind it! If you're building a static site (eg. a blog, something informational), it can be a huge productivity boost.

> NOTE: Gatsby has a wide array of "starters" for different usecases, but Guppy doesn't support them yet. We'll add this in a future update, but for now it might be best to create the product through a terminal and then import it into Guppy. See [their official docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-one/#check-your-development-environment) for more information.

Ultimately, the project type you choose depends on your goals. Some thoughts:

- Are you looking to become a professional web developer, and want to learn the craft? Choose "Vanilla React", so that you can learn more about creating React apps from scratch

- Are you looking to build a complex app, like a social network or an AirBnb clone? You'll likely want to go with "Vanilla React", as this is a bit outside the scope of what Gatsby was created for

- Are you looking to build a blog, landing page, or other content-based product? "Gatsby" can save you a ton of time, and is likely the best choice.
